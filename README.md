Welcome to the Self Code MVC Framework! This framework is a lightweight, modular solution for building web applications using PHP and JavaScript, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Below you'll find instructions on how to set up, use, and extend the framework.

Introduction
Self Code MVC is designed to simplify the development of web applications by organizing code into three main components:

Model: Manages the data and business logic.
View: Handles the presentation and user interface.
Controller: Manages the user input and interacts with the model and view.
Requirements
To use Self Code MVC, you need:

PHP 7.4 or higher
A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
A modern web browser
Optional: MySQL or another database if you are using a database
